Welcome to my Data Analysis Project! 🚀

In this project, I've harnessed the power of Python libraries such as pandas and numpy to clean and preprocess my data. Once the data was meticulously cleaned and ready for analysis, I connected it to a SQL server, loading the refined data to uncover crucial insights. 🔍

Project Highlights:

**Data Cleaning:** Utilized pandas and numpy for robust data cleaning, ensuring accuracy and consistency. 🧽

**Database Integration:** Connected the cleaned data to a SQL server for efficient storage and retrieval. 🗄️

**Insight Discovery:** Executed SQL queries to derive meaningful insights and actionable information from the data. 💡
This project demonstrates a seamless workflow from data cleaning to data analysis, showcasing the synergy between Python's data manipulation capabilities and SQL's powerful querying features. 🛠️

Repository Contents:-
**Data Cleaning Scripts:** Python scripts leveraging pandas and numpy for data preprocessing. 📜

**SQL Queries:** SQL scripts used for querying the cleaned data to extract insights. 📝

Documentation: Detailed documentation explaining the data cleaning process, SQL integration, and the insights discovered. 📚
